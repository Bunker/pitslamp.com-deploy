      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20121211_abb_autoworld-8281.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20121211_abb_autoworld-8281.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Electric car of ABB&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in a while, everything seems to work out, just as you hoped. This was the case when &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abb.be&#34; rel=&#34;contact met&#34; title=&#34;ABB&#34;&gt;ABB&lt;/a&gt; asked me to shoot an event featuring their electric car in the Jubelpark in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nissan Leaf had just been cleaned, the location was gorgeous and the evening sun was casting a marvelous light on the arc. The only thing I could think of was, putting the car in a good position and start shooting. The only thing that could go wrong, would have been when the law passed by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick edit in Lightroom and you get a result, that not only pleases your client, but also gives you a nice portfolio image. That&amp;rsquo;s all it takes sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20120813_abb_arcelor_mittal-3198.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20120813_abb_arcelor_mittal-3198.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ABB service engineers at Arcelor Mittal&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last august, I was on the road for 3 days shooting on several locations for ABB. They wanted to update their service brochure with new photos. We went to shoot at the harbour of Rotterdam, a service labo and more. It was an unique experience, I could go and shoot at some locations where you normally would have not been able to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20120810_abb_rotterdam_euromax-2980.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20120810_abb_rotterdam_euromax-2980.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ABB repair team at Euromax&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only was it an unique experience, but it was also very challenging to shoot during 3 days on several locations in the Netherlands and Belgium. I had strict guidelines to shoot in the house style. It is very rewarding to see that the most photos got used in the brochure as is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20120809_abb_etten-leur-2653.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20120809_abb_etten-leur-2653.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ABB test engineer in the labo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photos in this post are the originals and you can find them also in the &lt;a href=&#39;http://pitslamp.com/?attachment_id=477&#39; rel=&#39;attachment wp-att-477&#39;&gt;Service Benelux brochure 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
