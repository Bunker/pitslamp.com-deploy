&lt;p&gt;This is the last blogpost in my short series about my frustrations. Have a look at my previous ones over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://pitslamp.com/blog/20130607_frustrations-of-a-photographer&#34; title=&#34;PitsLamp photography | Frustrations of a photographer&#34; rel=&#34;me&#34;&gt;Frustrations of a photographer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://pitslamp.com/blog/20130531_what-does-a-photographer-cost&#34; title=&#34;PitsLamp photography | What does a photographer cost&#34; rel=&#34;me&#34;&gt;What does a photographer cost?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a photographer there are a number of clichés remarks that photographers hear on a daily basis. Some funny, some less funny and some are just insulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of the most heard remarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;paper-doesn-t-like-me&#34;&gt;Paper doesn&amp;rsquo;t like me.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the one I hear the most. It gives me the impression that most people don&amp;rsquo;t like themself. As a photographer I&amp;rsquo;m responsible for making sure everybody looks good on a photo, so with a remark like that you are basically telling me I&amp;rsquo;m not good at my job, even before you so any results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;made-any-good-photos-lately-it-has-to-with-such-a-camera&#34;&gt;Made any good photos lately, it has to with such a camera|&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to work with satisfied clients, this implies I do my job well and make good photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the previous, it does not matter what type of camera I use, when you had a good meal, you are not complimenting the chef on his stove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me the camera is a tool, a way to achieve a result. Obtaining the result with one camera may be easier than with another, but even with the most expensive and most advanced camera in the world, you can still make bad pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-can-photoshop-can-t-you&#34;&gt;You can photoshop, can&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A remark made by women as well as men. Yes I do make some adjustments on a photo, like colour, contrast and cadrage, however I&amp;rsquo;m not going to photoshop 300 photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not become photographer, to spend hours behind a computer, photoshopping wrinkles and excessive fat. I don&amp;rsquo;t like converting an honest portrait into a barbie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hey-hey-take-my-picture&#34;&gt;Hey, hey take my picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A remark made whenever somebody finds him or herself interesting and mostly combined with alcohol intoxication. If I want a photo, I&amp;rsquo;ll ask you or make it. However it can get worse, when that somebody interferes with a shoot I&amp;rsquo;m doing for other people, who payed for my time and expertise. Keep in mind that the photo I do make if you ask for it probably won&amp;rsquo;t make the cut after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;can-you-join-our-party-show-birth-8230-do-bring-your-camera&#34;&gt;Can you join our party/show/birth/&amp;#8230;, do bring your camera.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read my answer to this remark over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://pitslamp.com/blog/20130607_frustrations-of-a-photographer&#34; title=&#34;PitsLamp photography | Frustrations of a photographer&#34; rel=&#34;me&#34;&gt;Frustrations of a photographer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;have-a-look-at-our-vacation-photos-what-do-you-think&#34;&gt;Have a look at our vacation photos, what do you think?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Followed by a computer, iPad, iPhone or even a camera, with x thousand photos of their travel companion in front of some great view, photographed in the middle of the day and/or flashed (in very bad light). After about 100 photos my interest is gone, even it are photos from the best photographer in the world. Just make a selection and only show the 100 best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I don&amp;rsquo;t like to comment on photos if they are not from a fellow photographer, nobody wants to hear my comments on their photos, they just want to have the bragging rights, that a photographer liked their photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-this-coming-in-the-papers&#34;&gt;Is this coming in the papers?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every photos is meant to be put in a paper and even if it is for the paper, the photographer doesn&amp;rsquo;t decide which photo gets published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my last post in the mini series about my frustrations. Now we&amp;rsquo;re back to the normal routine on here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20130602_veronique_breugelmans-0659.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20130602_veronique_breugelmans-0659.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Frustrations of a photographer - Véronique&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I already mentioned in my previous post &lt;a href=&#34;http://pitslamp.com/blog/20130531_what-does-a-photographer-cost&#34; title=&#34;Wat kost een fotograaf? : PitsLamp Fotografie&#34; rel=&#34;me&#34;&gt;What does a photographer cost?&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m writing a series about the frustrations of a photographer. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about things that annoy me when sending quotes or receiving certain request from clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a small list with my most common frustrations and I also explain why I think these are frustrating, annoying or even insulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; I do not mean to offend anyone, but if you feel offend, accept my apologies in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;can-you-make-a-photo-report-we-ll-give-you-free-tickets&#34;&gt;Can you make a photo report, we&amp;rsquo;ll give you free tickets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This request is one of the reasons, I started this series of articles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job as a photographer is to create photos, during an assignment I&amp;rsquo;m focused on that task and I can&amp;rsquo;t really be part of whatever else is happening during the party/conference/show/award ceremony. So I&amp;rsquo;m sorry but tickets aren&amp;rsquo;t very useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it can be a really interesting subject for you and others, the subject probably is outside my area of expertise and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really connect with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-ll-get-photo-credits&#34;&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll get photo credits.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to be the golden ticket for a lot of companies/magazines/newspapers/&amp;#8230;, it doens&amp;rsquo;t matter if the photos will be used in a commercial or non-commercial publication. The logic being that it&amp;rsquo;s an honor as a photographer to be published. It may very well be that I think it&amp;rsquo;s an honor to be published, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get paid for the work I do/did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My credo is, if I do something for free it&amp;rsquo;s my decision. If there is any money involved (entrance, sponsoring, advertising purposes, &amp;#8230;), I&amp;rsquo;m not doing it for free or credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;our-budget-is-limited-to-xxx&#34;&gt;Our budget is limited to xxx&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is usually a reply after receiving a quote, meaning: Can&amp;rsquo;t you do the same work for less money. I&amp;rsquo;m really sorry but I can&amp;rsquo;t, have a look at my previous post &lt;a href=&#34;http://pitslamp.com/blog/20130531_what-does-a-photographer-cost&#34; title=&#34;Wat kost een fotograaf? : PitsLamp Fotografie&#34; rel=&#34;me&#34;&gt;What does a photographer cost?&lt;/a&gt;. However, what I can do for your budget is adjust the quote and reduce the workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;we-ll-need-to-photos-by-tomorrow-morning-xxam&#34;&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll need to photos by tomorrow morning xxam.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question that always follows at the end of an assignment and wasn&amp;rsquo;t mentioned at the time of the quote. Off course that&amp;rsquo;s possible, but it does cost more because it does require a lot more effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example delivery by the next morning, means I have to process everything during the night and it does happen quite often I&amp;rsquo;m working till 3-4am to get everything delivered on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also means, I have to adjust my planning for the next day. If I know before the assignment that I have to process everything the same day, I can take that into account when planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is possible, but I would prefer to know about it beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;we-would-like-every-photo-you-took&#34;&gt;We would like every photo you took.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one I do hear less and less, but it still happens. Sending you all photos isn&amp;rsquo;t possible. A good photo is a process of improving the previous photos. In the end a client only cares about the great photos, that can be published, there is no use to deliver every photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something every decent photographer will confirm. It only hurts my image as a photographer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;our-payment-terms-are-xx&#34;&gt;Our payment terms are xx&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a freelancer it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to have a decent cashflow, if clients decide to pay whenever pleases them, a cashflow is none existing. It can&amp;rsquo;t be that hard to wire money, can it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can continue for a bit, but I think I covered the most important ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The next post in this series will be about the remarks a photographer receives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
