&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20120421_project-30303030_shoot-27-0008.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20120421_project-30303030_shoot-27-0008.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Make up brush&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black and white portraits require a whole other approach on make-up and clothing than colour portraits. This should be kind of obvious because of the lack of colour, but it can be hard to imagine your make up in black and white. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to provide some pointers in this blogpost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost keep in mind that caucasian skin will be very close to white in a well lit black and white photo. This means you want to apply very little foundation. It is better to use more yellow looking foundation to cover up pimples, spots or reddish marks on your face or neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;colours:d0d4da73bd09df8c6afc3ac7ed3df7e7&#34;&gt;Colours&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In black and white most dark tones will look lighter than you think, they can be great to apply on all places where there are natural shadows and soften those places. You can use them on the hollows of cheeks, temples and eye sockets. Do not use darker colours on eyelids or brow bones instead only use them in the crease of eyes, and around your eyelash line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light tones will appear darker. A light toned concealer blended under your eyes, from the inside corners will, lighten the shadow under your eyes and lower you cheekbones. You can use highlights to accent the areas where the light falls, like bridge of the nose, brow bone, center of forehead and tops of your cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red is a special colour in black and white, it will turn out dark grey in black and white. So don&amp;rsquo;t use very bright red coloured lipstick if you don&amp;rsquo;t want black or dark grey lips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;texture:d0d4da73bd09df8c6afc3ac7ed3df7e7&#34;&gt;Texture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the lack of colour in black an white, texture will show very easily. This means you want to use a lot of blending to smooth out all the texture of the powders you are using. When you are drawing lines, like under your eyes or around you lips, don&amp;rsquo;t use a pencil, but use a small brush and paint a shadow instead of a line. This will give a more natural look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t use any glitter or wet look, glitter will only show up as white spots where the light hits it. A wet look lipstick can appear to be saliva which is not really a look you want on a portrait, unless it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wrap-up:d0d4da73bd09df8c6afc3ac7ed3df7e7&#34;&gt;Wrap up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use mainly prime colours, that way you can easily judge how they will look in black and white. If you are not sure how the colour will look in black and white take your camera or phone and put it in black and white mode, that way you see how it looks. Make sure you blend very well to remove all traces of texture. Watch out with wet looks, glosses and don&amp;rsquo;t use pencils but use brushes to create a shadow instead of lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always with make up don&amp;rsquo;t overdo it and don&amp;rsquo;t stop abruptly below your chin, try to create a kind of gradient to have your face match your chest area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I made any mistakes in this article please let me know, after all I&amp;rsquo;m not a make up artist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.conversity.be&#34; rel=&#34;friend met&#34; title=&#34;Conversity model&#34;&gt;Clo Willaerts&lt;/a&gt; decided to write a book about earning money with social media. Because she was working under a very tight time limit, she asked experts to write a piece related to social media in their area of expertise. That&amp;rsquo;s when &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/bnox&#34; title=&#34;Bnox on Twitter&#34; rel=&#34;friend met&#34;&gt;Clo&lt;/a&gt; contacted me to write a piece on profile pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January I wrote a piece on the subject on my dutch counterpart of this blog. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve translated this article so that you can read what I wrote in the book. You can find it under the title &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/blog/20110104_profielfoto&#34; title=&#34;Profile pictures, an art in itself&#34; rel=&#34;me&#34;&gt;Profile pictures, an art.&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve read the book myself and although I&amp;rsquo;m quite adapt at social media myself, I still learned a lot from the book. If you want to buy the book, there are several options available, it&amp;rsquo;s in the bookstores since wednesday 16/03/2011 or you can find it at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/The-Conversity-Model-ebook/dp/B004P8JX6K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;#038;m=A36UWAQAV1U1MD&amp;#038;s=books&amp;#038;qid=1300441839&amp;#038;sr=8-1&#34; title=&#34;conversity model in the Amazon store&#34; rel=&#34;contact met&#34;&gt;amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;. At amazon you can buy either the paper version or the kindle version.&lt;/p&gt;
