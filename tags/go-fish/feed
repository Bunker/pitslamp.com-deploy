&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[UPDATE] This blogpost was an April fools day joke, I will still be doing digital and film.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20110201_mamiyaRB67_film8-5.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20110201_mamiyaRB67_film8-5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Vredebox: the start of my film photography&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 2 weeks were very quiet over here and I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for that, but I have a really good reason for it, several reasons as a matter a fact. First of all it just have been very busy weeks, with a 4 day trip to the UK, a lot of shoots and other work. However the most important reason is that I have been struggling and debating with myself to make a lot of changes in my photography business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 years ago when I started this business, it was a second income and a hobby. That has changed a lot since then, not only the way I look at it, but also my own photographic style, life but also the medium I use for photography. I started out doing everything digital but I felt like something was missing in the way I was working. When I started photographing on film a couple of years ago, I almost immediately knew what had been missing till then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2009 I have come to master the whole process of film photography, starting with the different types of cameras, developing my own film and even printing in the darkroom on different surfaces. That also brought an important change, I was spending less time at the computer. Spending less time at the computer was one of the arguments to become a full time photographer, because I used to be a front-end webdeveloper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of all the reasons I mentioned above, I have been debating to quit doing digital photography for clients. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, this is a huge leap and I did not make this decision overnight. It&amp;rsquo;s been on my mind for some weeks now and I also have been investigating the whole thing, to make sure it is possible. So now that I have convinced myself that it is possible, I&amp;rsquo;ll just have to jump in the deep end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From today on I won&amp;rsquo;t be doing any digital photography for clients and will only focus on black and white film photography!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-s-the-impact-of-my-switch-to-film-photography-for-you-as-a-client&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the impact of my switch to film photography for you as a client?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, not that much is going to change, a list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll still be shooting events, advertising and portraits like before, the only difference is that everything will be black and white&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything will still be billed on a project basis, I won&amp;rsquo;t charge per roll of film or hourly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll still get a selection of the images in high res and web, but the originals will be on black and white film&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My standard post processing time will stay 5 working days, the only difference is that processing on location won&amp;rsquo;t be possible anymore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The biggest change is off course the lack of colour, I will only be shooting black and white.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the coming weeks, everything here will change accordingly. I wanted to have everything ready to be changed today, but due to the busy past weeks, that didn&amp;rsquo;t work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very excited for the future and hope that all of you will support this change and help me get the word out by sharing this blogpost.&lt;/p&gt;
