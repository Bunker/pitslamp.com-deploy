&lt;p&gt;This above photo is made as a concept for a contest organized by Nespresso. My girlfriend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saravdv.be&#34; title=&#34;There are no endings, only new beginnings&#34; rel=&#34;muse met&#34;&gt;Sara&lt;/a&gt; wanted to participate in this contest and so we made this picture on a saturday evening in our living room. She won the contest by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical side of this camera was not too hard, we just had to work out a way to loose highlights on the wall and the frame of the mirror. This because our living room consisted out of the all white walls and a white ceiling. I used 2 studio flashes, one with a softbox and one with a selfmade snoot.&lt;/p&gt;
