      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you take on the challenge of photographing with 3 different cameras, you encounter a couple of obstacles. So let me show you some of the problems I had to solve before shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and most important one is how to shoot with 3 different cameras. I had to setup a system to switch out the cameras and see if everything was still working. It was a hassle, but with some pockets and shoulder straps, you can keep all cameras with you at all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most challenging was figuring out how to sync my off camera flashes with the different cameras. Off course with the Pocket wizards I have, that was no problem for the 5D mk II. On the Samsung NX100 I had to switch a setting to have it trigger the pocketwizard without using the TTL. So that was not a real problem eiter. But how was I going to trigger the flashes with the Nokia N8. It has a flash so optical slaves was kind of a no brainer. But that gave me another problem, the flash in the n8 has a pre-flash, which triggered the flashes before the photo was made. Luckily my bowens Gemini 500R have a custom setting where you can set the number of pre flashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An other problem was that with the N8 you can&amp;rsquo;t use manual mode, so that you are not working with the same settings all the time. To solve this, I had to turn the exposure compensation all the way down. This gave me some more control over the final photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last I also had to figure out a way to mount the n8 to a tripod. I does not have a tripod mount, so I used a bungee ball to attach it to the handle of my manfrotto head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the problems were quite easy to solve, but they required some preparations and extensive testing at home to circumvent all the above problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not shoot any work for clients with a cellphone, just because I can. It is just a lot easier to shoot with a pro DSLR. But my goal was to prove that you can&amp;rsquo;t use the excuse that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to appropriate equipment for making great photos.&lt;/p&gt;
