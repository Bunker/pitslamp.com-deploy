&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20150510_randomn-06321.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20150510_randomn-06321.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Wind rooster&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;move&#34;&gt;Move&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is my move from Dendermonde to &lt;a href=&#34;http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sart-Risbart&#34;&gt;Sart-Risbart&lt;/a&gt;, a little village next to the E411 just below Louvain-la-neuve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move and the renovations before the move have taken up all my free time lately, which also means I haven&amp;rsquo;t been taking photos like I would like, but hopefully that will change in the coming time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also my move doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;m leaving behind all my clients, definitely not, I&amp;rsquo;m just expanding my horizon with a possible extra set of clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hacked&#34;&gt;Hacked&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other is the reason why this site is in a horrible condition for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last couple of months, this site and others that I&amp;rsquo;m maintaining have been subject of continuous attacks by spammers and black hat hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got that bad, that one of my sites even got warnings from google. No matter what I tried, I was fighting a loosing battle. It seemed that the hackers had fought a way in one of my websites and were so able to access all my other sites as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to move my websites away from wordpress and use a static site generator, his name is &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. This means that everything on this site is plain HTML and Javascript and I&amp;rsquo;m generating the pages on my own computer. A welcome extra is that the site loads a lot faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition went very smooth, but because of the hacking most of my photos have been deleted (&lt;em&gt;by myself by accident&lt;/em&gt;), I&amp;rsquo;m slowly finding all the photos and will add them back in the next couple of days. As you guessed however it is a monks work, so it takes time, to do it by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid this issue in the future, my source-files are now on dropbox and my site is also available as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Bunker/pitslamp.com/&#34;&gt;repository on github&lt;/a&gt;. That way I always have several backups of my website and it&amp;rsquo;s contents and I can even rebuild and deploy a previous version, so that I always have a working site online.&lt;/p&gt;
