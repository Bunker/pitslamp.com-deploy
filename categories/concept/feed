      <title>[Client] Pepsi and Beyoncé nail art</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/nailart_pepsi.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/nailart_pepsi.png&#34; alt=&#34;Pepsi nail art&amp;gt;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half may the pop artist Beyonc&amp;eacute; was supposed to give 2 shows in Antwerp. For this event, the people of Pepsi launched a short campaign to promote Pepsi and their link to Beyonc&amp;eacute;. They asked &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.passionfornails.be&#34; title=&#34;Passion for nails&#34; rel=&#34;contact met&#34;&gt;Rebecca Lal&lt;/a&gt;, champion of Belgium in nail art to create a tutorial for painting the swirl of Pepsi on your own nails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s how I ended up in a very unfamiliar place on morning in April, to shoot the illustrative photos for the tutorial. The result is the flyer you see above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a fun assignment to do and definitely a challenge to photograph.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electric car in Brussels</title>
      <link>http://www.pitslamp.com/blog/20130203_electric-car-in-brussels</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20121211_abb_autoworld-8281.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20121211_abb_autoworld-8281.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Electric car of ABB&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in a while, everything seems to work out, just as you hoped. This was the case when &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abb.be&#34; rel=&#34;contact met&#34; title=&#34;ABB&#34;&gt;ABB&lt;/a&gt; asked me to shoot an event featuring their electric car in the Jubelpark in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nissan Leaf had just been cleaned, the location was gorgeous and the evening sun was casting a marvelous light on the arc. The only thing I could think of was, putting the car in a good position and start shooting. The only thing that could go wrong, would have been when the law passed by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick edit in Lightroom and you get a result, that not only pleases your client, but also gives you a nice portfolio image. That&amp;rsquo;s all it takes sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>[PitsLamp shorts] iMinds advertising banner</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/68057_10151197199929127_202644223_n.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/68057_10151197199929127_202644223_n.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;iMinds advertising photo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October the independent research facility IBBT changed it&amp;rsquo;s name to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iminds.be&#34; title=&#34;iMinds&#34; rel=&#34;contact met&#34;&gt;iMinds&lt;/a&gt;. They hired me to do some advertising photography for the resulting campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This image was shot on a green key and extracted in Photoshop so it could be used in the design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget you can still book a portrait session with a big signed darkroom portrait print and decide yourself how much it’s worth: &lt;a href=&#34;http://pitslamp.com/blog/20130106_i-shoot-you-decide-ii-large-portrait&#34; title=&#34;I shoot, you decide: large portrait&#34; rel=&#34;me&#34;&gt;More info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>[Client] ABB: service brochure</title>
      <link>http://www.pitslamp.com/blog/20121113_client-abb-service-brochure</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.pitslamp.com/blog/20121113_client-abb-service-brochure</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20120813_abb_arcelor_mittal-3198.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20120813_abb_arcelor_mittal-3198.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ABB service engineers at Arcelor Mittal&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last august, I was on the road for 3 days shooting on several locations for ABB. They wanted to update their service brochure with new photos. We went to shoot at the harbour of Rotterdam, a service labo and more. It was an unique experience, I could go and shoot at some locations where you normally would have not been able to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20120810_abb_rotterdam_euromax-2980.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20120810_abb_rotterdam_euromax-2980.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ABB repair team at Euromax&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only was it an unique experience, but it was also very challenging to shoot during 3 days on several locations in the Netherlands and Belgium. I had strict guidelines to shoot in the house style. It is very rewarding to see that the most photos got used in the brochure as is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20120809_abb_etten-leur-2653.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20120809_abb_etten-leur-2653.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ABB test engineer in the labo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photos in this post are the originals and you can find them also in the &lt;a href=&#39;http://pitslamp.com/?attachment_id=477&#39; rel=&#39;attachment wp-att-477&#39;&gt;Service Benelux brochure 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>[PitsLamp shorts] Self-portrait</title>
      <link>http://www.pitslamp.com/blog/20120402_self-portrait</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://500px.com/photo/6250412&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pcdn.500px.net/6250412/9ee9a0311c3f7b4a9987143eff6643bc259f3a60/4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Selfportrait by Filip Bunkens (Pitslamp) on 500px.com&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today my motivation for work is kinda low, because of all kinds of creative ideas floating around in my head. So I decided to just play for an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skylight in our living room catches quite a lot of sun and whenever the sun is coming through it, I tend to stop for a moment and enjoy the sun on my face. That gave me the idea, to shoot a adoration picture of myself enjoying the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The kingdom vs Sony alpha 900</title>
      <link>http://www.pitslamp.com/blog/20110503_the_kingdom</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.pitslamp.com/blog/20110503_the_kingdom</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, Sony gave me a alpha 900 to test during some weeks. As is becoming a habit lately I&amp;rsquo;m not very into reviewing the technical aspects or comparing it to other cameras. Instead I try the camera in a real life situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into a making a stop-motion video for some time now. So this was the perfect opportunity to try this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to make just any stop-motion, but do it as a kind of a video clip for a song with a meaning. So I chose The kingdom of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.milow.com&#34; title=&#34;milow&#34; rel=&#34;contact met&#34;&gt;Milow&lt;/a&gt;. A number about the current political situation in Belgium&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a look at the result below. Just to be clear it is not the official video of The Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/23018445&#34;&gt;Proof of concept: Milow &amp;#8211; The Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/pitslamp&#34;&gt;PitsLamp&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com&#34;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me 13 hours to make the video and couldn&amp;rsquo;t have done it without the help of my great girlfriend. Also I asked and got permission of Milow to use his song in this video, which I&amp;rsquo;m very grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More than you see</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/5501020556/&#34; title=&#34;More than you see by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5136/5501020556_b0eee4b71a.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; alt=&#34;More than you see&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This above photo is made as a concept for a contest organized by Nespresso. My girlfriend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saravdv.be&#34; title=&#34;There are no endings, only new beginnings&#34; rel=&#34;muse met&#34;&gt;Sara&lt;/a&gt; wanted to participate in this contest and so we made this picture on a saturday evening in our living room. She won the contest by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical side of this camera was not too hard, we just had to work out a way to loose highlights on the wall and the frame of the mirror. This because our living room consisted out of the all white walls and a white ceiling. I used 2 studio flashes, one with a softbox and one with a selfmade snoot.&lt;/p&gt;
