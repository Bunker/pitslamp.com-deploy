      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/helena.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/helena.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Helena&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, a happy New Year to all of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During last month I launched a little project, some of you might know this, for the others, here is a short sitwrap. I proposed a shoot on black and white film with as a result 2 a5 and 1 a4 print. After seeing the result, the client got to decide what all this is worth to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At announcement and during the month of december I got asked to share the results. So here it goes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project ran from the 24th november till the 24th of december. During this period I received 4 bookings, here are some facts about the clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 knew me before the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 found my action through facebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 couple, 2 sisters, 1 family and 1 portraitshoot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20 to 30 photos per shoot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question I heard the most was: &amp;#8220;Aren&amp;rsquo;t you going to cut in your own flesh with this project?&amp;#8221; Here are the numbers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 to 3 times transport, 2h of shoots and at least 2h darkroom work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost of the material for every shoot: 50 euro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal price: 200 to 250 euro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average amount payed per shoot: 190 euro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average extra order: 75 euro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average total amount per shoot: 265 euro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the results show, the perceived value of the shoot is very close to the price I put on the shoot. I&amp;rsquo;m satisfied with the results and had loads of fun working with these clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the success I&amp;rsquo;ll repeat the I shoot, you decide project again at certain points in time. Every time the package will change a bit. Follow here for more info.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Samsung NX200 review</title>
      <link>http://www.pitslamp.com/blog/20120131_samsung_nx200</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://500px.com/photo/4714271&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pcdn.500px.net/4714271/d51bb124b647a08f46e9e108f4813314e78d9765/4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;[Samsung nx200] Long exposures by Filip Bunkens (Pitslamp)) on 500px.com&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a photographer, I get to test new cameras once in a while. That&amp;rsquo;s how I got my hands on a Samsung NX200 camera, a mirror less camera with exchangeable lenses. I&amp;rsquo;m skipping the technical details, as that&amp;rsquo;s outside the scope of this blog. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in a more technical review, check out my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.achter.be&#34; title=&#34;Achter, photography, tech and coffee&#34;&gt;other blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the NX200 during an extensive period as my everyday camera, it&amp;rsquo;s light, quite small and pretty fast. I have used some other mirror less cameras before and let me start with saying it&amp;rsquo;s not the best mirror less camera I have used till now, but definitely not the worst either. However I haven&amp;rsquo;t found a mirror less camera that is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/6796066811/&#34; title=&#34;[Samsung nx200] NOTP by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7025/6796066811_fbc09b8ec9.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; alt=&#34;[Samsung nx200] NOTP&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first encounter with the NX200 was when Samsung invited me to the Night of the Proms in Antwerp in the beginning of last november. Everyone invited, was given an NX200 camera and the permission to photograph during the concert. As the camera looks like a point and shoot, you can easily take it to a concert and use there, but it&amp;rsquo;s not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera is small so pretty hard to keep it steady, there is no viewfinder so you need to shoot with the LCD and you need a rather large lens to get a nice shot. Next to those inconveniences there&amp;rsquo;s also the fact that above iso 800 you get a lot of noise, which for me ruins a photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://500px.com/photo/4714308&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pcdn.500px.net/4714308/cc7bd653dc8402e2871aee39975ca5463fa1f52b/4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;[Samsung nx200] Long exposures by Filip Bunkens (Pitslamp)) on 500px.com&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when you stay below 800 iso, I really like the camera. The interface is very intuitive, the quality of the lenses and build quality of the camera is very good. Even very long exposures in color almost don&amp;rsquo;t show any noise on low iso&amp;rsquo;s, as you can see in the photo above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/6796342627/&#34; title=&#34;[Samsung nx200] Logitech F540 by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7168/6796342627_8e4fea1b01.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; alt=&#34;[Samsung nx200] Logitech F540&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hot shoe on the nx200 is a very nice extra, it makes it possible to use the nx200 with pocketwizards or other off camera flash triggers. This makes that even in a studio this camera can be pretty useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/saravdv/6620214279/&#34; title=&#34;NewYear-London by saravdv, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7171/6620214279_3a40af9991.jpg&#34; width=&#34;333&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; alt=&#34;NewYear-London&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;copy; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saravdv.be&#34; title=&#34;Saravdv&#34; rel=&#34;muse friend met&#34;&gt;Sara VdV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the other features, that&amp;rsquo;s very useful are the presets, I really do like the B/W one, but Samsung has decided to go a step further, they even included some lomo-style effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/6796072185/&#34; title=&#34;[Samsung nx200] NOTP by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7164/6796072185_6e46230f2c.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; alt=&#34;[Samsung nx200] NOTP&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These effects can be added during shooting or afterwards. Although I like to edit my photos afterwards myself, the filters are quite nice and can be useful when you have to quickly deliver photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So overall I do like the camera especially for the intuitive interface and the good quality, but I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of the image quality in the higher ISO range. If Samsung would solve that problem, this camera or it successor will be awesome. If you are looking for a camera during your vacation, I would highly recommend this one, but make sure to get yourself a decent flash for evening photography.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review Pirates of the cameras</title>
      <link>http://www.pitslamp.com/blog/20110217_review_pirates</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.pitslamp.com/blog/20110217_review_pirates</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you take on the challenge of photographing with 3 different cameras, you encounter a couple of obstacles. So let me show you some of the problems I had to solve before shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and most important one is how to shoot with 3 different cameras. I had to setup a system to switch out the cameras and see if everything was still working. It was a hassle, but with some pockets and shoulder straps, you can keep all cameras with you at all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most challenging was figuring out how to sync my off camera flashes with the different cameras. Off course with the Pocket wizards I have, that was no problem for the 5D mk II. On the Samsung NX100 I had to switch a setting to have it trigger the pocketwizard without using the TTL. So that was not a real problem eiter. But how was I going to trigger the flashes with the Nokia N8. It has a flash so optical slaves was kind of a no brainer. But that gave me another problem, the flash in the n8 has a pre-flash, which triggered the flashes before the photo was made. Luckily my bowens Gemini 500R have a custom setting where you can set the number of pre flashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An other problem was that with the N8 you can&amp;rsquo;t use manual mode, so that you are not working with the same settings all the time. To solve this, I had to turn the exposure compensation all the way down. This gave me some more control over the final photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last I also had to figure out a way to mount the n8 to a tripod. I does not have a tripod mount, so I used a bungee ball to attach it to the handle of my manfrotto head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the problems were quite easy to solve, but they required some preparations and extensive testing at home to circumvent all the above problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not shoot any work for clients with a cellphone, just because I can. It is just a lot easier to shoot with a pro DSLR. But my goal was to prove that you can&amp;rsquo;t use the excuse that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to appropriate equipment for making great photos.&lt;/p&gt;
