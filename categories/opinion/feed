&lt;p&gt;This is the last blogpost in my short series about my frustrations. Have a look at my previous ones over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://pitslamp.com/blog/20130607_frustrations-of-a-photographer&#34; title=&#34;PitsLamp photography | Frustrations of a photographer&#34; rel=&#34;me&#34;&gt;Frustrations of a photographer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://pitslamp.com/blog/20130531_what-does-a-photographer-cost&#34; title=&#34;PitsLamp photography | What does a photographer cost&#34; rel=&#34;me&#34;&gt;What does a photographer cost?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a photographer there are a number of clichés remarks that photographers hear on a daily basis. Some funny, some less funny and some are just insulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of the most heard remarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;paper-doesn-t-like-me&#34;&gt;Paper doesn&amp;rsquo;t like me.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the one I hear the most. It gives me the impression that most people don&amp;rsquo;t like themself. As a photographer I&amp;rsquo;m responsible for making sure everybody looks good on a photo, so with a remark like that you are basically telling me I&amp;rsquo;m not good at my job, even before you so any results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;made-any-good-photos-lately-it-has-to-with-such-a-camera&#34;&gt;Made any good photos lately, it has to with such a camera|&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to work with satisfied clients, this implies I do my job well and make good photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the previous, it does not matter what type of camera I use, when you had a good meal, you are not complimenting the chef on his stove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me the camera is a tool, a way to achieve a result. Obtaining the result with one camera may be easier than with another, but even with the most expensive and most advanced camera in the world, you can still make bad pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-can-photoshop-can-t-you&#34;&gt;You can photoshop, can&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A remark made by women as well as men. Yes I do make some adjustments on a photo, like colour, contrast and cadrage, however I&amp;rsquo;m not going to photoshop 300 photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not become photographer, to spend hours behind a computer, photoshopping wrinkles and excessive fat. I don&amp;rsquo;t like converting an honest portrait into a barbie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hey-hey-take-my-picture&#34;&gt;Hey, hey take my picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A remark made whenever somebody finds him or herself interesting and mostly combined with alcohol intoxication. If I want a photo, I&amp;rsquo;ll ask you or make it. However it can get worse, when that somebody interferes with a shoot I&amp;rsquo;m doing for other people, who payed for my time and expertise. Keep in mind that the photo I do make if you ask for it probably won&amp;rsquo;t make the cut after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;can-you-join-our-party-show-birth-8230-do-bring-your-camera&#34;&gt;Can you join our party/show/birth/&amp;#8230;, do bring your camera.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read my answer to this remark over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://pitslamp.com/blog/20130607_frustrations-of-a-photographer&#34; title=&#34;PitsLamp photography | Frustrations of a photographer&#34; rel=&#34;me&#34;&gt;Frustrations of a photographer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;have-a-look-at-our-vacation-photos-what-do-you-think&#34;&gt;Have a look at our vacation photos, what do you think?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Followed by a computer, iPad, iPhone or even a camera, with x thousand photos of their travel companion in front of some great view, photographed in the middle of the day and/or flashed (in very bad light). After about 100 photos my interest is gone, even it are photos from the best photographer in the world. Just make a selection and only show the 100 best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I don&amp;rsquo;t like to comment on photos if they are not from a fellow photographer, nobody wants to hear my comments on their photos, they just want to have the bragging rights, that a photographer liked their photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-this-coming-in-the-papers&#34;&gt;Is this coming in the papers?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every photos is meant to be put in a paper and even if it is for the paper, the photographer doesn&amp;rsquo;t decide which photo gets published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my last post in the mini series about my frustrations. Now we&amp;rsquo;re back to the normal routine on here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20130602_veronique_breugelmans-0659.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20130602_veronique_breugelmans-0659.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Frustrations of a photographer - Véronique&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I already mentioned in my previous post &lt;a href=&#34;http://pitslamp.com/blog/20130531_what-does-a-photographer-cost&#34; title=&#34;Wat kost een fotograaf? : PitsLamp Fotografie&#34; rel=&#34;me&#34;&gt;What does a photographer cost?&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m writing a series about the frustrations of a photographer. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about things that annoy me when sending quotes or receiving certain request from clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a small list with my most common frustrations and I also explain why I think these are frustrating, annoying or even insulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; I do not mean to offend anyone, but if you feel offend, accept my apologies in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;can-you-make-a-photo-report-we-ll-give-you-free-tickets&#34;&gt;Can you make a photo report, we&amp;rsquo;ll give you free tickets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This request is one of the reasons, I started this series of articles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job as a photographer is to create photos, during an assignment I&amp;rsquo;m focused on that task and I can&amp;rsquo;t really be part of whatever else is happening during the party/conference/show/award ceremony. So I&amp;rsquo;m sorry but tickets aren&amp;rsquo;t very useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it can be a really interesting subject for you and others, the subject probably is outside my area of expertise and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really connect with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-ll-get-photo-credits&#34;&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll get photo credits.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to be the golden ticket for a lot of companies/magazines/newspapers/&amp;#8230;, it doens&amp;rsquo;t matter if the photos will be used in a commercial or non-commercial publication. The logic being that it&amp;rsquo;s an honor as a photographer to be published. It may very well be that I think it&amp;rsquo;s an honor to be published, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get paid for the work I do/did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My credo is, if I do something for free it&amp;rsquo;s my decision. If there is any money involved (entrance, sponsoring, advertising purposes, &amp;#8230;), I&amp;rsquo;m not doing it for free or credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;our-budget-is-limited-to-xxx&#34;&gt;Our budget is limited to xxx&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is usually a reply after receiving a quote, meaning: Can&amp;rsquo;t you do the same work for less money. I&amp;rsquo;m really sorry but I can&amp;rsquo;t, have a look at my previous post &lt;a href=&#34;http://pitslamp.com/blog/20130531_what-does-a-photographer-cost&#34; title=&#34;Wat kost een fotograaf? : PitsLamp Fotografie&#34; rel=&#34;me&#34;&gt;What does a photographer cost?&lt;/a&gt;. However, what I can do for your budget is adjust the quote and reduce the workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;we-ll-need-to-photos-by-tomorrow-morning-xxam&#34;&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll need to photos by tomorrow morning xxam.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question that always follows at the end of an assignment and wasn&amp;rsquo;t mentioned at the time of the quote. Off course that&amp;rsquo;s possible, but it does cost more because it does require a lot more effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example delivery by the next morning, means I have to process everything during the night and it does happen quite often I&amp;rsquo;m working till 3-4am to get everything delivered on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also means, I have to adjust my planning for the next day. If I know before the assignment that I have to process everything the same day, I can take that into account when planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is possible, but I would prefer to know about it beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;we-would-like-every-photo-you-took&#34;&gt;We would like every photo you took.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one I do hear less and less, but it still happens. Sending you all photos isn&amp;rsquo;t possible. A good photo is a process of improving the previous photos. In the end a client only cares about the great photos, that can be published, there is no use to deliver every photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something every decent photographer will confirm. It only hurts my image as a photographer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;our-payment-terms-are-xx&#34;&gt;Our payment terms are xx&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a freelancer it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to have a decent cashflow, if clients decide to pay whenever pleases them, a cashflow is none existing. It can&amp;rsquo;t be that hard to wire money, can it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can continue for a bit, but I think I covered the most important ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The next post in this series will be about the remarks a photographer receives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20111013_ibbt_iminds_2011-5870.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/images/blogposts/20111013_ibbt_iminds_2011-5870.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;What does a photographer cost - image of people discussing&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several years as a full time photographer, I have gathered a couple of things I want to clarify or rectify. That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to write a short series of articles about my cost and frustrations as a photographer. I&amp;rsquo;ll publish the whole series during the next couple of days. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll start off by answering the question, what does a photographer cost and why I have to set this cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;situation&#34;&gt;Situation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll assume I got the following request. I have to photograph during 3 hours, capturing the atmosphere and speakers at an event in the centre of Brussels. The photos will only be used on a website as a photo essay of the evening. No special requests&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-much-does-a-photographer-cost&#34;&gt;How much does a photographer cost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below you see a quote I would send out for this assignment. I used an imaginary coin, the numbers only represent the values compared to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photography during 3h. (with a marge of 1h) &amp;#8211; 147 bunkies (ex. VAT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Material: reportage kit &amp;#8211; 73 bunkies (ex. VAT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transport inside benelux &amp;#8211; 49 bunkies (ex. VAT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selection and processing of the images within 5 business days &amp;#8211; 73 bunkies (ex. VAT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage and archiving during 5 years- 49 bunkies (ex. VAT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivery of the selected images in web and high resolution through a shared folder on dropbox.com or via wetransfer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete and unlimited use of the photos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes a total 391 bunkies (ex. VAT) for this quote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-this-price&#34;&gt;Why this price&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us analyse every cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-hours-of-photography&#34;&gt;3 hours of photography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cost of 147 bunkies, means an hourly wage of 49 bunkies, at least that&amp;rsquo;s for the hours I&amp;rsquo;ll be photographing. If you receive an hourly wage from an employer that does seem a lot. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how much time I actually spent on this event, even without processing the photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process the request for a quote, make appointements, check the route, etc&amp;#8230; &amp;#8211; this can easily be 1h30min.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrive 30 to 45 min. in advance, to make the last appointements and prepare all the material&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The start of the event is 15 min. late&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As advertised it takes 3hours, but it goes 15 minutes over time, as events do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checking with the responsible that it&amp;rsquo;s ok to leave and put away all my gear takes about 15 min.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total that&amp;rsquo;s 5 till 5h30min. Let&amp;rsquo;s reconsider my hourly wage now. It goes down from 49 bunkies to +/- 30 bunkies before taxes and social costs. To keep it easy I&amp;rsquo;ll assume those are 40%, so my netto hourly wage is 18 bunkies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;material&#34;&gt;Material&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I need to shoot an event and why do I count this as a cost, I have bought this anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 camera + 1 backup camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-4 lenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flash, minimal 1 preferably 2 and backup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;batteries + backup batteries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lenscloths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All together this is about 8000 bunkies, this means to pay of my gear I have to do +/- 110 assignments. Off course it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there, because whenever anything fails, I have to use my backup and try to replace it before the assignment. If I can&amp;rsquo;t replace it, I have to rent or borrow equipment, that&amp;rsquo;s cost of time, transport and maybe a renting price. But as a customer you&amp;rsquo;re sure I&amp;rsquo;ll be on the assignment with appropriate gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;transport&#34;&gt;Transport&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;49 bunkies to go from Aalst to Brussels and back, ain&amp;rsquo;t that a bit much? Let&amp;rsquo;s analyse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard transportcost of 0,35 bunkies/km, Aalst-Brussels-Aalst = 50 km x0,35 bunkies, total of 17,5 bunkies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parking in Brussels for 5h to 6h &amp;#8211; 2,5 bunkies/h makes about 12,5 bunkies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time traveling + finding a parking spot without traffic jams &amp;#8211; 1u&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost for parking and transport is 30 bunkies. That makes 20 bunkies for my time or 12 bunkies after tax. But my transport is fixed inside the benelux, so that means if I&amp;rsquo;m driving to Brussels or Amsterdam it&amp;rsquo;s the same price, you can make your own calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;selection-and-processing&#34;&gt;Selection and processing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Als rule of thumb every hour spent shooting during an event is half an hour processing, let&amp;rsquo;s see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transferring photos to the computer &amp;#8211; 45 min.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First round going through and eliminating all the bad ones &amp;#8211; 10 min.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second round going through, making small adjustments for colour and exposure, developing the photos if you will &amp;#8211; 45 min.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third round going through checking all images and deleting duplicates &amp;#8211; 10 min.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preparing export and exporting to dropbox &amp;#8211; 40 min.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checking export and sending it all to the client &amp;#8211; 10 min.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a total of 2h10min., let&amp;rsquo;s round off to 2hours. That means my hourly wage is now 36,5 bunkies. But we forget to calculate the cost for the computer, card reader, programs, internet connection, dropbox account, all necessary for processing the images. That cost is about 3000 bunkies, using the same value of 110 assignments, that makes about 27 bunkies. I&amp;rsquo;m left with 23 bunkies hourly wage or about 14 bunkies after taxes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;storage-and-archiving&#34;&gt;Storage and archiving&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that every customer can ask for their images again within a time period of 5 years without any extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 archiving disk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 backup of the archiving disk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 backup of the computer, not every image is archived directly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 offsite backup of all the above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good archiving system, so that everything can be found again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time to find the images and deliver them again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to pick an exact value for these things, but for 5 years it does not look as an exaggerated cost&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusie-for-what-does-a-photographer-cost&#34;&gt;Conclusie for what does a photographer cost?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem that you pay a lot for a photographer, but after analysing the prices and their cost, you can see that it&amp;rsquo;s really not that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The next article is about the frustrations as a payed photographer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
